# ASP.NET Core and SignalR Chat

Based on https://github.com/aspnet/SignalR-samples/tree/master/ChatSample

This version is optimized for sharing code, with Markdown rendering powered by [Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig), and easy copying of messages
to the clipboard. 

Other key changes:
- All HTML messages are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
- Updated to use .NET Core 3.1 and razor pages
